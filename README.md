### 🙏 8:30 AM – 9:30 AM | **A Spiritual Beginning at Gurdwara Sahib**

Our first day started with peace — at the **Gurdwara Sahib** inside campus.

 The circular structure, the calm vibes — it felt just right.

 The *Kirtani Jatha* (3 members) recited:
- Japji Sahib Ji (Path)
- "Satguru Hoe Diaal Taan Shraddha Poori" (Shabad)
- Chaupai Sahib Ji (Path)

 Then came a recitation from the **Guru Granth Sahib Ji**, followed by **Ardaas** — a prayer for our future.  
Honestly, it was the perfect way to begin this new chapter.

### ☕ Tea Break @ Hostel No. 2

Short and sweet. Tea was served right across from the Gurdwara. Everyone was still figuring things out, meeting people, soaking it all in.

### 📝 Registration & Welcome Kit

📍 Outside the auditorium  
We registered, got our welcome kits 🎁, and settled into our seats for the main event.
