## 📅 **Day 1 – A Spiritual Start & Powerful Insights**

### 🙏 8:30 AM – 9:30 AM | **A Spiritual Beginning at Gurdwara Sahib**

Our first day started with peace — at the **Gurdwara Sahib** inside campus.

 The circular structure, the calm vibes — it felt just right.

 The *Kirtani Jatha* (3 members) recited:
- Japji Sahib Ji (Path)
- "Satguru Hoe Diaal Taan Shraddha Poori" (Shabad)
- Chaupai Sahib Ji (Path)

 Then came a recitation from the **Guru Granth Sahib Ji**, followed by **Ardaas** — a prayer for our future.  
Honestly, it was the perfect way to begin this new chapter.

### ☕ Tea Break @ Hostel No. 2

Short and sweet. Tea was served right across from the Gurdwara. Everyone was still figuring things out, meeting people, soaking it all in.

### 🙏 Science, Maths & Spirituality

One of the most striking moments was when Dr. Jaswinder Singh drew a connection between **Science, Mathematics, and Divinity**.

> 🧘‍♂️ “Mathematics is the language of the universe, and science is how we decode the design of the Creator.”

He emphasized how **every formula, pattern, and principle in nature** reflects **a deeper cosmic order** — a reminder that understanding science can also be a **spiritual experience**.

✨ This idea made us pause and reflect — maybe solving equations or experimenting in the lab isn't just academics... maybe it's our way of understanding something bigger.

### 🧠 11:00 AM – 1:00 PM | **“Universal Human Values” by Dr. Priya Darshini Ma’am**
