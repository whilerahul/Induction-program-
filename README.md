## 📅 **Day 1 – A Spiritual Start & Powerful Insights**

### 🙏 8:30 AM – 9:30 AM | **A Spiritual Beginning at Gurdwara Sahib**

Our first day started with peace — at the **Gurdwara Sahib** inside campus.

 The circular structure, the calm vibes — it felt just right.

 The *Kirtani Jatha* (3 members) recited:
- Japji Sahib Ji (Path)
- "Satguru Hoe Diaal Taan Shraddha Poori" (Shabad)
- Chaupai Sahib Ji (Path)

 Then came a recitation from the **Guru Granth Sahib Ji**, followed by **Ardaas** — a prayer for our future.  
Honestly, it was the perfect way to begin this new chapter.

### ☕ Tea Break @ Hostel No. 2

Short and sweet. Tea was served right across from the Gurdwara. Everyone was still figuring things out, meeting people, soaking it all in.

His session left us motivated to look at science not as a boring subject — but as something alive, fun, and truly powerful when taught the right way.

### 🙏 Science, Maths & Spirituality

One of the most striking moments was when Dr. Jaswinder Singh drew a connection between **Science, Mathematics, and Divinity**.

> 🧘‍♂️ “Mathematics is the language of the universe, and science is how we decode the design of the Creator.”

He emphasized how **every formula, pattern, and principle in nature** reflects **a deeper cosmic order** — a reminder that understanding science can also be a **spiritual experience**.

✨ This idea made us pause and reflect — maybe solving equations or experimenting in the lab isn't just academics... maybe it's our way of understanding something bigger.

### 🧠 11:00 AM – 1:00 PM | **“Universal Human Values” by Dr. Priya Darshini Ma’am**  

This one went *deeper than expected*.

👩‍🏫 **Discussion Points:**
- How **values shape our relationships**, choices, and life path  
- The difference between **what we want vs. what we really need**  
- The importance of being a good human before being a good professional  

> 📝 “**Being successful means nothing if you're not grounded in values.**”  
> — A quote that stayed with me

---

### 💬 Reflection  

Today was calm but **heavy in meaning**.  
It reminded me that we’re not just here to earn a degree — but to **grow as people**.  
Not every lecture needs to be flashy — some just make you pause and reflect.  
And that’s powerful.
